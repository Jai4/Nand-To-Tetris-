# Nand-To-Tetris-
<p>
The Nand to Tetris course takes you on a self-paced fascinating voyage of discovery in which you will go all the way from Boolean algebra and elementary logic gates to building a Central Processing Unit, a memory system, and a hardware platform, leading up to a general-purpose computer that can run any program that you fancy. In the process of building this computer you will become familiar with many important hardware abstractions, and you will implement them, hands on. But most of all, you will enjoy the tremendous thrill of building a complex and useful system from the ground up.
